## Introduction

Codenest Version is a project developed for [Hackathon Name]. It is dedicated to making coding accessible and enjoyable for kids and learners of all ages. Our platform's primary goal is to inspire a love for coding in everyone who uses it.

## Key features of Codenest Version include:

- One-on-one peer-to-peer doubt solving: Students can get personalized assistance from their peers.
- Integrated IDE with live collaboration: With just one click, users can collaborate in real-time with teachers and peers directly within the IDE.
- Enhanced privacy: Unlike platforms like Zoom that provide full access, Codenest Version prioritizes user privacy and security.
- Live lectures integrated with IDE: Lectures are seamlessly integrated with the IDE, allowing users to follow along with code demonstrations and examples.
